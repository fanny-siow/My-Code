HTML NOTES:
    <p> paragraph
    <h1> main header
    <img> images
    <form> form
    b (whatever letter) > tab (shortcut)
    HTML - HyperText Markup Language
    CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
    JavaScript - actions
    (search) - mdn
    paragraph in html - anything you want to group together not necessarily just text
    should only have 1 h1 at a time, which should always be the top header on top of the page
    h1-h6 must always be in order (can't do h5 w/o h4, can't do h3 w/o h2, etc)
    headings are just for structure, formatting (size, color, etc) can always be changed.
    html skeleton (boilerplate)
    "<!DOCTYPE html> flag to browser using HTML5
    <html> aka root element represents the top-level element, all other elements are the child. permitted elements 1 <head> and 1 <body>
    <head> aka document metadata, information about webpage, scripts, etc style sheets css
        <title>My First Page </title> (title is what you see in the tab/google uses it for results)
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Content Goes Here -->
    </body>
    </html>"
    vs shortcut: "! tab"
    lists: ol = ordered lists, ul = unordered lists. li must be inside <ol> or <ul>
    nested lists:
    <ol> or <ul>
        <li></li>
    </o> or <ul>
    <a>: the anchor element - hyperlink. need attributes - pieces of information we can pass in inside a tag (before the closing >). not in between an opening & closing tag but inside a tag
    example:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://example.com">Website</a></li>
    </ul>
    <img src="" alt=""> no closing tag, src = source where you put the link, alt is the text description of the image
    <!--text--> HTML comments
    <div> content division element, generic container to group things together. block lvl element.
    <span> generic container, inline element.
    <hr> a break/line/divider no closing tag
    <br> line break
    <sup> elevated off the baseline aka exponents
    <sub> below the baseline sometimes smaller
    html entities all start with & end with ; used as filler for symbols that are difficult to type. ie copyright symbol, arrows, accented letters. also reserved characters [<>]. can be words or numbers. 
    semantic markup - meaningful markup
    <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading element as a child of the <article> element
    <aside> a side element lmao

shortcut for notes is "ctrl + /"
ctrl + shift + p = to search
format shortcut = shift + alt + F
alt + shift + up/down arrow to copy lines up/down
HREF stands for hypertext reference
HTML5 - new version of html lmao. HTML standard is the document.
html.spec.whatwg.org
inline elements fit in alongside other elements
block lvl elements take up a whole "block" of space
